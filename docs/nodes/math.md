# Math

**Math** nodes are essential to every game, allowing a script to do anything from moving an object each frame to computing the probability of specific scenarios based on a wide array of input chracteristics.
Godot, and by extension Orchestrator, provide dozens of mathematical nodes to perform any type of computation.

## Operators

Orchestrator classifies math operations into **5** key groups:

| Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Boolean       | Compares two values to determine their equality or relative comparison.<br/>*Examples: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, or `>=`*                                           |
| Numeric Math  | Performs a unary operation on a single value or binary operation on two or more values.<br/>*Examples: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `-Unary`, `+Unary`, `%`, or `^` (power).* |
| Bitwise       | Performs bitwise operations on a given numeric value.<br/>*Examples: Shift left, Shift right, And, Or, Xor, or Negate.*                                              |
| Logic         | Performs a logical comparison between one or two values.<br/>*Examples: And, Or, Xor, and Not*                                                                       |
| Containment   | Checks whether a value is contained within a collection.<br/>*Examples: `has` or `contains`*                                                                         |

Orchestrator looks at all the possible combinations of operations between various data types and generates a unique operator node for each combination.
For example, the node to add two `Integer` values differs from a node that adds two `Float` values.

At first glance, this may seem strange, but it's generally better in visual scripting to enforce a bit more type safety than in text-based code where it's much easier to point the user to a specific line when a type coercion or invalid value is recognized.
The following shows several different examples of various math operator nodes.

## Add math nodes {#add-math-nodes}

To add a math node to the orchestration, simply:

1. Right-click the graph to access the **All Actions** dialog.
2. Search for the math operation, for example `Multiply`.
3. Select the right math operation for the two operand types.

:::note
**Math** nodes are initially categorized by the first operand type.
For example, the **Multiply** node that accepts an `Integer` as the first argument will be under the `Math > Integer` category.
The operand type included in the parenthesis that follows the operation specifies the second argument type.

So to add a node that multiplies an `Integer` with a `Float`, you would search for the **Multiply** node under the `Math > Integer` category, selecting the action labeled `Multiply (Float)`.

## Changing math operands

After placing a **Math** node, if you need to change the operand type of one of the input values, then you must select a new node that matches your desired operands.
By following the [Add math nodes](#add-math-nodes) procedure, you can add the appropriate node and connect all the input/output pins before removing the old node.

To remove the old node, simply:

1. Select the node in the graph.
2. Either Right-Click and select **Delete** from the context-menu or simply press the `Del` button.
